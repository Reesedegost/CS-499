My professional ePortfolio contains the following:

Your code review video

    Located in youtube & each categories .md / .html
    
Your original and enhanced artifact or artifacts

    Located in Original Artifact folder & Enhanced Artifacts folder
    
Your narratives addressing the enhancements you have implemented, the specific skills you have demonstrated, and the specific course outcomes that align with your enhancements.

    Located in Narratives folder
    
Your professional self-assessment. While you complete this last in the course, it should be the first thing presented in your ePortfolio. The self-assessment will function as a holistic introduction to you, your skills that can be quantifiably supported with your completed enhancements of the artifacts, and your ePortfolio.
